# Cranberry Relish

I like this relish. It's interesting and pungent and tasty.

My dad first heard this recipe on WCBS radio in NYC, probably in the late 1970s, and he wrote to the station requesting a transcript. They sent it to him, and he cooked this cranberry relish at Thanksgiving every year after that. Eventually, the paper copy of the receipe he had received from the radio station was getting tattered and worn, and he transcribed the recipe onto his computer a few days before Thanksgiving, 1999. Now, ten years later, a few days before Thanksgiving, I've transcribed it onto a Web page here.

From Anthony Dias Blue, WCBS food editor: "I learned this recipe when I was a judge at the National Cranberry cookoff several years ago. The lady who created this relish won her $1000.00 and an engraved silver trophy."

# Ingredients

* one lemon, seeded and diced, including the peel
* one orange, seeded and diced, including the peel
* 1½ cups of fresh or frozen whole cranberries,
* 2 cups of dark brown sugar,
* 1½ cups of raisins,
* 1 cup of fresh or canned pitted cherries,
* ½ cup of white vinegar,
* ½ teaspoon of ground cinnamon,
* ½ teaspoon of ground cloves,
* ½ teaspoon of nutmeg, and
* ½ of a cinnamon stick.

# Directions

Combine all ingredients in a saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil; then reduce the heat and simmer for 15 minutes. Remove the cinnamon stick. Cool, then refrigerate. This will keep in the refrigerator for 2-3 weeks or it can be frozen in plastic containers. The recipe makes 6 cups of relish which is good with turkey, ham, chicken or pork.
